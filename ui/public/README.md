# Public Directory

Files in this directory are served as-is at the root URL without being processed by Vite.

## Usage

Files here are available at the root path:

```html
<!-- File: public/favicon.ico -->
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />

<!-- File: public/robots.txt -->
<!-- Available at: https://yoursite.com/robots.txt -->
```

## What Goes Here

- **favicon.ico** - Site favicon
- **robots.txt** - Search engine crawler instructions
- **manifest.json** - PWA manifest
- **Open Graph images** - Social media preview images
- Other static files that need predictable URLs

## Important

- Files are NOT optimized or hashed
- Use absolute paths starting with `/`
- For assets used in components, use `assets/` directory instead
